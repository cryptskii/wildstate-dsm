/**
 * A player-vs-player match: two teams of up to three, one creature out at a time, whoever knocks
 * out all of the other side's creatures wins. Both players choose a move each turn without seeing
 * the other's; the turn resolves once both are in.
 *
 * Every turn is resolved by the staked-match program (src/domain/program.ts: DSM's
 * `wildstate-duel`, compiled to WebAssembly), free matches and staked ones alike, so what a screen
 * shows is exactly what an escrow settles. The match keeps the setup's bytes, the program's state
 * after the last turn and every turn's openings; the teams, log and events here are views of
 * those for the screens. Each team is a snapshot of the creatures as the player prepared them
 * (HP and charges, so healing and charging beforehand matters); the match never writes back to
 * the players' own creatures.
 *
 * The program's rules: a level tie's first actor comes from the tiebreak seed, a move the rules
 * cannot play (or bytes that are no move) is a pass, Resign hands the other side the win, and
 * after 60 turns more team HP wins, equal HP going to the seed. There is never a tie.
