/**
 * DSM underneath the game (DSM Amendment A11).
 *
 * The game stays what it was: walking, encounters and battles run here on
 * the game server and never touch DSM. What a player owns lives in the
 * player's DSM wallet on their phone: WILD, the game's coin, and each caught
 * creature, a state object of supply one. The player connects the wallet
 * once by scanning a code; after that the game asks the wallet for what the
 * player granted (accept a creature, pay for a capsule, quote and swap in the
 * market, prove holdings) with no going back and forth to the phone.
 *
 * Nothing a wallet answers is evidence. The game grants a capsule only when
 * its own account accepted the payment, and takes coins and creatures only
 * from holdings proofs its account verified (`connect.app.status`).
 *
 * The overlay shows both lanes as they happen: what the game server did
 * (Web2) and what DSM did underneath, as the game's account recorded it.
