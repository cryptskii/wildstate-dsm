/**
 * Staked matches, decided by the program (SoFi Amendment S22): no referee, no verdict.
 *
 * The game builds the match's setup (both players' session keys, both teams as their latest
 * published states, a nonce from both wallets and the match, and the program `P`), then asks A's
 * wallet to lock its stake and B's to lock against A's vault. Each wallet checks the setup, both
 * teams and (B) A's vault itself. Both then ready: A signs its ready, the game relays it to B, and
 * B's wallet writes the Start. A real-world ready timeout is the game's: when it runs out, the
 * wallet left waiting withdraws, and the match is void with both stakes refunded.
 *
 * Each turn, each player's choice is sealed by their own wallet (a Commit entry), and once both
 * are sealed each wallet reveals its own; the game relays every signed entry to the other wallet,
 * which checks it before it signs its next. The turn is then resolved by the same program the
 * escrow runs. Escaping is a Resign. A player whose turn timer runs out while connected has their
 * own wallet sign a pass; a player who is away freezes the match until they come back (owner
 * ruling: no clock decides a staked match). At the end the winner's wallet settles the transcript
 * at the match cell and collects both stakes.
