/**
 * The game's economy on DSM (DSM Amendment A11, the §78 picture): the game
 * stays a Web2 game, and what a player owns lives in the player's wallet.
 *
 * - WILD, the game's coin: a token the game's account created; its whole
 *   supply is the account's, and it pays players from it.
 * - The WILD/ERA market: MARKET_VAULTS SoFi vaults the account funds in equal slices, so
 *   players' swaps through different vaults never race for one vault's key.
 * - Each creature a state object: a token of supply one the account creates
 *   when the creature is caught. Its committed policy names the game as
 *   issuer, the species and the capture; its policy commitment is the
 *   creature's identity. HP and XP stay game data, keyed by that identity.
 *
 * This file is the game's own Web2 record of what it did on DSM (which
 * anchors are its coin and its creatures, its players' game profiles). It is
 * never evidence of ownership: holdings come from proofs the account verifies.
